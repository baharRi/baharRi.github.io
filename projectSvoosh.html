        <h2>Interaction design for android application</h2>
        <p>
          In the class of <strong>IN2000: Software Engineering</strong> (Spring
          2022), I worked in an interdisciplinary team with other informatics
          students to create an application made to guide the people of Oslo on
          their bicycling journeys. The app uses APIs from the
          <u>Norwegian Meteorological Institute</u> and was created through
          <strong>agile software development</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the team I was given the role as
          <strong>head designer,</strong> and my responsibilities were to plan
          interactions with users as well as creating design mockups and
          <strong>implementing the design</strong> into the app using the markup
          language XML. The rest of the application was created using Kotlin,
          which I also contributed to occasionally.
