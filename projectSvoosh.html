                <h3>Project description</h3>
                <p>
                    In the class of <strong>IN2000: Software Engineering</strong>, I worked in an 
                    interdisciplinary team with other informatics students (developers + designers) 
                    to create an application made to guide the people of Oslo on their bicycling 
                    journeys throughout the city. 
                    The app uses weather APIs from the <u>Norwegian Meteorological Institute</u> 
                    and was created through an <strong>agile software development</strong> process.
                </p>
                <p>After the Covid-19 pandemic, more and more people are using cycling as a mode of 
                    transportation in Oslo to avoid public transport. The market for systems aiding 
                    the activity is growing significantly. Through the application, we hope to encourage 
                    the local people of Oslo to continue to choose sustainable options for public 
                    transportation.</p>

                ><strong>"Create an application that shows recommended biking routes in 
                    Oslo, where variables such as traffic should be taken into account."<br />
                <br />
                "Establish a system that raises and maintains commitment and motivation around 
                bicycling as a sustainable mode of transportation; this is important both for the safety 
                of the population and in a larger perspective - for the global society."</strong></em

              <h3 class="underline">Problems</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" style="color:#53847c"></i> An application for easy access to bicycling paths in Oslo is growing increasingly necessary as more people are engaging in the activity.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" style="color:#53847c"></i> Cycling roads are hard to keep track of and few and far between, and often times bikers end up having to cycle on the road, next to dangerous traffic.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" style="color:#53847c"></i> Cycling in poor weather conditions and high traffic areas can worsen the experience and demotivate cyclists from engaging in the activity.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <br />

              <h3 class="underline">Project objectives</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" style="color:#53847c"></i> Focus on the local environment and surroundings and be future-oriented.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" style="color:#53847c"></i> Give the user the option to add locations to their favorites, for easy access and usability.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" style="color:#53847c"></i> Recommend relevant biking paths for the user, depending on weather and air quality, to motivate and encourage using bicycling as a mode of transportation.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right" style="color:#53847c"></i> Display the weather and air quality in the area to help the user plan their bicylcing days and routes.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>These objectives are only within the scope of the project timeline. <br />
                <strong>The goal in the long-run</strong> is for this application to encourage and help the people of Oslo choose bicycling as a preferred mode of transportation to make Oslo a more sustainable city. 
                We aim to give more planning opportunities for the people interested in bicycling in Oslo, to make it into a more enjoyable experience, and continue to motivate bicycling as a healthy personal habit.
