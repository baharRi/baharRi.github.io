      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a masters student at the University of Oslo, studying
        <strong>informatics: design, use & interaction</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that well-made design can contribute to create better
        experiences for anyone. I am firm in my belief that design is crucial
        for shaping the world into a better place that is
        <strong>more accessible, equitable, and sustainable for everyone</strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am eager to collaborate with teams of fellow designers as well as
        other disciplines in order to craft technology that serves as a tool for
        empowerment and helpfulness, rather than contributing to exclusion. My
        areas of interest are
        <strong>interaction design & digitalization</strong>. I see value in
        small details, and I am highly driven to reach my own expectation of
        perfection with every project I come across.

        <h3>AtomIQ</h3>
        <h4>Interaction layer for crypto investment application</h4>
        <p>
          In the class of <strong>IN3010: Transformative Design</strong> (Spring
          2023), with a focus on <em>social sustainability</em>, my design team
          partnered with an established team of developers to create a wireframe
          of the interaction design layer of their upcoming investment app
          AtomIQ.
        </p>
        <p>
          This mockup was not focused on aesthetics, but rather how we could
          contribute our expertise within HCI and creativity as students to
          create an application that
          <strong>encourages and educates</strong> new users for the sake of
          democracy within the field of finance.

        <h3>Svoosh</h3>
        <h4>Interaction design for android application</h4>
        <p>
          In the class of <strong>IN2000: Software Engineering</strong> (Spring
          2022), I worked in an interdisciplinary team with other informatics
          students to create an application made to guide the people of Oslo on
          their bicycling journeys. The app uses APIs from the
          <em>Norwegian Meteorological Institute</em> and was created through
          <strong>agile software development</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the team I was given the role as
          <strong>head designer,</strong> and my responsibilities were to plan
          interactions with users as well as creating design mockups and
          <strong>implementing the design</strong> into the app using the markup
          language XML. The rest of the application was created using Kotlin,
          which I also contributed to occasionally.

        <h3>P4L</h3>
        <h4>Designing, building, & Arduino-programming of P4L the robot</h4>
        <p>
          In the class of <strong>IN1060: Use Oriented Design</strong> (Spring
          2021), in a group with fellow design students, we created
          <em>P4L: a friendly robot</em> designed to encourage socializing and a
          sense of responsibility as well as
          <strong>fighting loneliness</strong> in a time of crisis and
          quarantine.
        </p>
        <p>
          P4L was created using Arduino in order to implement functionality such
          as the ability to feed and pet the robot, as well as having it
          communicate through sounds and movements.
