          <h2>About me</h2>
          
        <p>
          I am a masters student at the University of Oslo, studying
          <strong>informatics: design, use & interaction</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that well-made design can contribute to create better
          experiences for anyone. I am firm in my belief that design is crucial
          for shaping the world into a better place that is
          <strong>more accessible, equitable, and sustainable for everyone</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am eager to collaborate with teams of fellow designers as well as
          other disciplines in order to craft technology that serves as a tool for
          empowerment and helpfulness, rather than contributing to exclusion. My
          areas of interest are
          <strong>interaction design & digitalization</strong>. I see value in
          small details, and I am highly driven to reach my own expectation of
          perfection with every project I come across.

          <h3>AtomIQ</h3>
          <h4>Interaction layer for crypto investment application</h4>
          <p>
            In the class of <strong>IN3010: Transformative Design</strong> (Spring
            2023), with a focus on <u>social sustainability</u>, my design team
            partnered with an established team of developers to create a wireframe
            of the interaction design layer of their upcoming investment app
            AtomIQ.
          </p>
          <p>
            This mockup was not focused on aesthetics, but rather how we could
            contribute our expertise within HCI and creativity as students to
            create an application that
            <strong>encourages and educates</strong> new users for the sake of
            democracy within the field of finance.

          <h3>Svoosh</h3>
          <h4>Interaction design for android application</h4>
          <p>
            In the class of <strong>IN2000: Software Engineering</strong> (Spring
            2022), I worked in an interdisciplinary team with other informatics
            students to create an application made to guide the people of Oslo on
            their bicycling journeys. The app uses APIs from the
            <u>Norwegian Meteorological Institute</u> and was created through
            <strong>agile software development</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the team I was given the role as
            <strong>head designer,</strong> and my responsibilities were to plan
            interactions with users as well as creating design mockups and
            <strong>implementing the design</strong> into the app using the markup
            language XML. The rest of the application was created using Kotlin,
            which I also contributed to occasionally.

          <h3>P4L</h3>
          <h4>Designing, building, & Arduino-programming of P4L the robot</h4>
          <p>
            In the class of <strong>IN1060: Use Oriented Design</strong> (Spring
            2021), in a group with fellow design students, we created
            <u>P4L: a friendly robot</u> designed to encourage socializing and a
            sense of responsibility as well as
            <strong>fighting loneliness</strong> in a time of crisis and
            quarantine.
          </p>
          <p>
            P4L was created using Arduino in order to implement functionality such
            as the ability to feed and pet the robot, as well as having it
            communicate through sounds and movements.
